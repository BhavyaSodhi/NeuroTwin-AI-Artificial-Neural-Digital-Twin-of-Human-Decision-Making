# NeuroTwin-AI-Artificial-Neural-Digital-Twin-of-Human-Decision-Making
NeuroTwin AI is an Artificial Neural Digital Twin system designed to model and simulate human decision-making behavior using deep learning. It takes inputs such as risk level, time pressure, reward expectation, stress, previous loss, and reaction time to predict a user’s decision (Accept or Reject), confidence level, cognitive score, and personality type. Each user is assigned a personalized neural model that evolves over time, allowing the system to track behavioral changes through brain drift analysis, cognitive similarity comparison, and personality clustering. In essence, NeuroTwin AI creates a virtual brain replica that learns from decisions and continuously adapts, enabling advanced behavioral analysis, psychological research, and intelligent human-AI simulation.
